 ABSTRACT = {The vertices of regular four-dimensional polytopes are used to generate sets of uniformly distributed three-dimensional rotations, which are provided as tables of Euler angles. The spherical moments of these orientational sampling schemes are treated using group theory. The orientational sampling sets may be used in the numerical computation of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and in spherical tensor analysis procedures.},

 abstract = {A Monte Carlo method is used to evaluate the Euclidean version of Feynman's sum over particle histories. Following Feynman's treatment, individual paths are defined on a discrete (imaginary) time lattice with periodic boundary conditions. On each lattice site, a continuous position variable xi specifies the spacial location of the particle. Using a modified Metropolis algorithm, the low-lying energy eigenvalues, |ψ0(x)|2, the propagator, and the effective potential for the anharmonic oscillator are computed, in good agreement with theory. For a deep double-well potential, instantons were found in our computer simulations appearing as multi-kink configurations on the lattice.}
