# Discretizations approaches for SU(2) and their effects on lattice gauge theories

Hello there,
my name is Timo Jakobs and this repository contains my bachelors thesis in physics supervised by Prof. Dr. Carsten Urbach from the university of Bonn.




## numerics

The [numerics](https://github.com/teajay99/bachelor_thesis/tree/main/numerics) folder contains the implementaiton of the Metropolis-Monte-Carlo algorithm used for this thesis. It uses C++ and makes use of Nvidias CUDA library. Further details can be found [here](https://github.com/teajay99/bachelor_thesis/blob/main/numerics/README.md).

## thesis

In the [thesis](https://github.com/teajay99/bachelor_thesis/tree/main/thesis) folder the LaTeX source code of the final report can be found. They also contain some symbolic links to plots and pictures created within the export folder in the [data_analysis_scripts
](https://github.com/teajay99/bachelor_thesis/tree/main/data_analysis_scripts) folder. These are unresolved, when initially cloning the repository, as the files are created by the python scripts found in the [data_analysis_scripts
](https://github.com/teajay99/bachelor_thesis/tree/main/data_analysis_scripts).
